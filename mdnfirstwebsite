		<p> As I learn to code, I'm having trouble with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>designing my pages (I'm just not very creative)</li>
			<li>CSS (cascading style sheets)</li>
			<li>APIs (application program interfaces)</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I know that with practice, more tutorials like this, and patience, I'll definitely improve though.</p>
